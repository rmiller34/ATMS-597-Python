# ATMS-597-Python
In this course, graduate students will gain experience using python language-based tools to analyze weather and climate datasets, and learn tools that will allow for the development of statistical representations of data and their uncertainties. Topics covered will include (1) object-oriented python programming, (2) version control, open source, and open data best practices, (3) using pandas and xarray for wrangling data, (4) parallelization in python and big data, (5) supervised learning, including linear, logistic, Bayesian, random forest regression techniques, and (6) unsupervised learning, including clustering, empirical orthogonal functions, and neural and deep learning.
